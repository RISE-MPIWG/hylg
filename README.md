The file `FetchTextFromRISE.py` was first composed by [Calvin Yeh](https://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/users/cyeh) and contains the Python code for fetching the texts in RISE's **MPIWG - 哈佛燕京** collection. You can also modify it to fetch other texts made available via RISE, once you familiarize yourself with the [SHINE API](https://rise.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/pages/doc_for_developers) protocol.
